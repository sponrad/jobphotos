tell your friends what is good to eat

add signup form to landing page and link to login page
login and accounts, login.php signup.php logout.php
after logging -> home screen feed.php , trending page of friends (later we have api hookups)
	trending page shows madlib and photo +/-
button to vote .... vote.php
	photo
	restaurant
	dish
	madlib
	+/-
	(so a vote has geo data)
profile page  profile.php?i=121
	same as trending page but just filtered for you
some way to follow and connect



Feed.

get all activity of all your friends... so
Users.all().filter("friends", userid).activity().sort(date) ???
Reveiws.all().filter("owner" IN (listoffriendids)).sort(date).limit(50)

common to all pages:
if user logged in information in a cookie or localstorage, set a variable
